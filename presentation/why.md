# Why creating a service?

## Automatic Startup

Services can be configured to start automatically when the system boots, ensuring your application is always running without manual intervention.

## Run Without User Login

Services can operate in the background without requiring a user to be logged in, making them ideal for server applications or long-running tasks.

## Process Management

The system manages service processes, automatically restarting them if they crash, enhancing reliability and uptime.

## Resource Control

Services can be configured with specific resource limits and priorities, allowing better system resource management.

## Enhanced Security

Services can run under specific user accounts with limited privileges, enhancing system security.

## Dependency Management

Services can be configured to start in a specific order, ensuring that dependencies are properly handled.

## Logging and Monitoring

Services integrate well with system logging facilities, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot issues.

## Standardized Control

Services can be managed using standard system tools (like systemctl on systemd-based systems), providing a consistent interface for starting, stopping, and checking status.

## Scalability

Services are well-suited for distributed systems and can be easily managed across multiple machines.

## System Integration

Services can interact more seamlessly with other system services and components.

## Easier Maintenance

Services can often be updated or restarted without affecting other system operations.
